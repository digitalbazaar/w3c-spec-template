Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for verifiable,
decentralized digital identity. These new identifiers are designed to enable the
controller of a DID to prove control over it and to be implemented independently
of any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority.
These sorts of identifiers often utilize a heavy-weight registry, such as ones
utilizing Decentralized Ledger Technologies (DLT), to create, read, update,
and deactivate DIDs. This specification describes a non-registry based DID
Method based on expanding a cryptographic public key into a DID Document. This
approach provides the simplest possible implementation of a DID Method that
is able to achieve many, but not all, of the benefits of utilizing DIDs.
